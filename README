As per problem specifications, this code represents a web application fragment, which takes user input (first name, last name, company, email and phone number) and creates record in SalesForce Leads and MainChimp List.

Both sevices expose REST APIs, which are used in this code. SalesForse also requires authentication, "OAuth 2.0 username & password" is a preffered flow here.

Only one use case: enter data, press Save button.
